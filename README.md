## Context

Currently, under the rapid pace of environmental destruction, Voyager wishes to bring a solution to help people raise awareness about environmental protection through the EcoCollector gamification.

Players can play the role of a farmer and build their own small farm. In it, they will be challenged in interesting mazes, and need to perform tasks such as scavenging, sorting garbage and avoiding "polluted" monsters to receive interesting rewards. With these rewards, players can use it to create more advanced items or exchange them for in-kind gifts such as crops or vouchers, as well as the opportunity to try new mazes.
